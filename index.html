<h1 class="span1" align="left">&#128073; Coronavirus</h1><hr>
<p><strong>Coronavirus(COVID-19)</strong> is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).The disease was first identified in 2019 in Wuhan, the capital of Hubei, China, and has since spread globally, resulting in the 2019â€“20 coronavirus pandemic. Common symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath. Muscle pain, sputum production, diarrhea, and sore throat are less common.<br><br>While the majority of cases result in mild symptoms,some progress to pneumonia and multi-organ failure.As of 23 March 2020, the rate of deaths per number of diagnosed cases is 4.4 percent; however, it ranges from 0.2 percent to 15 percent, according to age group and other health problems.<br><br>
The virus is typically spread during close contact and via respiratory droplets produced when people cough or sneeze.Respiratory droplets may be produced during breathing but it is not considered airborne.It may also spread when one touches a contaminated surface and then their face.It is most contagious when people are symptomatic, although spread may be possible before symptoms appear.The virus can live on surfaces up to 72 hours.<br><br>Time from exposure to onset of symptoms is generally between two and fourteen days, with an average of five days.The standard method of diagnosis is by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) from a nasopharyngeal swab.<br><br>The infection can also be diagnosed from a combination of symptoms, risk factors and a chest CT scan showing features of pneumonia.
Recommended measures to prevent infection include frequent hand washing, social distancing (maintaining physical distance from others), and keeping hands away from the face.he use of masks is recommended for those who suspect they have the virus and their caregivers, but not for the general public, although simple cloth masks may be used by those who desire them.There is no vaccine or specific antiviral treatment for COVID-19.<br><br>Management involves treatment of symptoms, supportive care, isolation, and experimental measures.</p>

<h1 class="span1" style="align:left;margin:20px;">&#128073; Symptoms</h1><hr>
<img class="center" src="https://www.mygov.in/sites/all/themes/mygov/images/covid/symptoms.jpg">
<p>Although those infected with the virus may be asymptomatic, many develop flu-like symptoms, including fever, cough, and shortness of breath.Emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, persistent chest pain or pressure, confusion, difficulty waking, and bluish face or lips; immediate medical attention is advised if these symptoms are present.<br><br>Less commonly, upper respiratory symptoms, such as sneezing, runny nose, or sore throat may be seen. Symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea have been observed in varying percentages among people in several studies, with percentages varying from 3% to 31% of cases depending on the study.Some initial cases in China presented only chest tightness and palpitations.In some, the disease may progress to pneumonia, multi-organ failure, and death.
As it is common with infections, there is a delay from when a person is infected with the virus to when they develop symptoms, known as the incubation period.<br><br>The incubation period for COVID-19 is typically five to six days but may range from two to 14 days.97.5% of people who develop symptoms will do so within 11.5 days of infection.</p>

<h1 class="span1" align="left">&#128073; How It Spreads</h1><hr>
<img class="center" src="https://www.mygov.in/sites/all/themes/mygov/images/covid/block-one.jpg">
<p>The coronavirus - known as COVID-19 - spreads from person to person in close proximity, similar to other respiratory illnesses, such as the flu.
Droplets of bodily fluids - such as saliva or mucus - from an infected person are dispersed in the air or on surfaces by coughing or sneezing.
These droplets can come into direct contact with other people or can infect those who pick them up by touching infected surfaces and then their face.<br><br>
According to scientists, coughs and sneezes can travel several feet and stay suspended in the air for up to 10 minutes.
It is not yet known how long the virus can survive outside a host but, in other viruses, it ranges from a few hours to months.
Transmission is of particular concern on transport, where droplets containing the coronavirus could pass between passengers or via surfaces like aeroplane seats and armrests.<br><br>
The incubation period of the coronavirus, the length of time before symptoms appear, is between one and 14 days.<br><br>
Although not yet confirmed, Chinese health authorities believe the virus can be transmitted before symptoms appear.
This would have major implications for containment measures, according to Gerard Krause, head of the Department for Epidemiology at the Helmholtz Centre for Infection.<br><br>
"It's unusual for respiratory diseases transmissible even before the first symptoms have occurred," he told Al Jazeera.<br><br>
"But the consequences is that if it happens then they have no public health means to sort out or to identify people at risk of transmitting, because they don't even know that they're ill yet."</p>

<h1 class="span1" align="left">&#128073; Prevention</h1><hr>
<img class="center" src="https://www.mygov.in/sites/all/themes/mygov/images/covid/block-two.jpg">
<p>There is currently no vaccine to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
The best way to prevent illness is to avoid being exposed to this virus.
The virus is thought to spread mainly from person-to-person.
Between people who are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet).
Through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes.
These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs.</p><br>
<p>Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds especially after you have been in a public place, or after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing.
If soap and water are not readily available, use a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. Cover all surfaces of your hands and rub them together until they feel dry.
Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.</p><br>
<p>Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when you cough or sneeze or use the inside of your elbow.
Throw used tissues in the trash.
Immediately wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not readily available, clean your hands with a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol.</p><br>
